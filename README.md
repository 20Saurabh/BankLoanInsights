**Advanced Bank Loan Data Analysis: Empowering Decision-Making through Dynamic Insights**

****Problem Statement************

The current approach to loan data analysis lacks depth and interactivity, hindering the ability to derive meaningful insights for informed decision-making. Traditional reporting methods fall short in providing a comprehensive view of lending operations, borrower behavior, and loan performance metrics. There is a pressing need for advanced dashboard design to address these limitations and unlock the full potential of our loan data.

**Objective**

Our objective is to craft a suite of interconnected dashboards that deliver dynamic and comprehensive insights into our loan data, empowering decision-makers with actionable intelligence derived from robust data analysis. These dashboards are meticulously designed to offer a holistic perspective on our lending operations, borrower demographics, loan performance, and financial metrics, facilitating strategic decision-making based on data-driven insights.

**Dashboard Overview**

**Dashboard 1: Executive Summary**

**Purpose:**

This dashboard provides an overview of critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) essential for evaluating the overall efficiency and performance of our lending endeavors.

**Key Features:**

Total Loan Applications: Monitor total and Month-to-Date (MTD) applications, scrutinizing Month-over-Month (MoM) trends for actionable insights.

Total Funded Amount: Evaluate the cumulative disbursed funds and track MTD disbursements, analyzing MoM variations to discern funding patterns.

Total Amount Received: Assess cash inflows via total and MTD received amounts from borrowers, scrutinizing MoM fluctuations for financial health assessment.

Average Interest Rate: Determine the cost of lending by computing and tracking the average interest rate across all loans, including MTD and MoM changes.

Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluate borrowers' financial resilience by calculating the average DTI for all loans and monitoring these metrics over time.
